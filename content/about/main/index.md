  Lately, I've been reading up on recency biases, fuzzy-trace theory, and investor behavior.  Along with this, I've been working on a proposal that examines the impact of artificial intelligence on the depreciation of assets over time.  How can a technology that becomes inherently more valuable with age affect the nearly one-third of global operating cash flows.  This idea first came from a fantastic [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/8c263c06-fc70-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167) article in 2018.
