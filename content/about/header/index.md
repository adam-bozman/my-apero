  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Finance and Management Science](https://business.wsu.edu/departments/finance-management-science/) at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/).

My general research interests are in empirical corporate finance and behavioral finance with a focus on risk, production efficiency, and artificial intelligence.  The overarching goal of my research is to develop fundamental strategies in the corporate framework that influence the adoption of emerging technologies.

My current research is motivated by real-world applications, like the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mergers and acquisitions (e.g., GPT-4). If you're so inclined, more information is included in my [CV](https://www.adambozman.com/about/CV.pdf/)!

Before WSU, I received my MBA with a concentration in Finance from [Gonzaga University](https://www.gonzaga.edu/school-of-business-administration).

I am very fortunate to work with my advisor [Dr. DJ Fairhurst](https://directory.business.wsu.edu/Directory/Profile/dj.fairhurst/).
