  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Finance and Management Science](https://business.wsu.edu/departments/finance-management-science/) at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/).

My general research interests are in empirical asset pricing and behavioral finance with a focus on emerging markets, compliance, and artificial intelligence.  The overarching goal of my research is to develop fundamental pricing techniques in emerging asset classes while influencing and educating the necessary regulatory framework for these asset classes to succeed.    

My current research is motivated by real-world applications, like alternatives to international sanctions (e.g., SWIFT alternatives), volatility in commodity markets (e.g., oil volatility post US expansionism), and the development of contemporary asset classes following the US financial crisis (e.g., cryptocurrency and DeFi).

Before WSU, I received my MBA with a concentration in Finance from [Gonzaga University](https://www.gonzaga.edu/school-of-business-administration).

I am very fortunate to work with my advisor [Dr. George Jiang](https://directory.business.wsu.edu/Directory/Profile/george.jiang/).
