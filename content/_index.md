description: "I am a doctoral candidate in the [Carson College of Business](https://business.wsu.edu/graduate-programs/phd-business/students-grads/) at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/) where my research focuses on empirical asset pricing, behavioral topics, emerging markets, and some monetary policy.  My goal is to aid in the understanding of individual decision making as well as investor biases, so we can better predict market reactions and necessary regulation."
